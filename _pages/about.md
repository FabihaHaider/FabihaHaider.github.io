Hi, I'm Fabiha Haider. I have completed my graduation from **Department of Computer Science and Engineering**, **University of Dhaka**, Bangladesh, and am currently employed as ML Research and Development Engineer at Penta Global Ltd and Krait Labs Ltd. I am currently working on projects for developing LLM systems for telecom data and for SAST scanners.

Research Interests
======
My current research interest lies in NLP and intersection of LLM and Security, mainly AI Security. I am particularly interested in LLM Applications, focusing on LLM Idiosyncrasies, exploitations and mitigation.
