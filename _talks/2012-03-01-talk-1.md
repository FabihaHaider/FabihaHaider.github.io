A workshop on the working principles of modern LLMs held at the University of Dhaka, organized by IEEE SBC DU Branch. In it, we talked at length how LLMs work, from explaining about transformers to the process of pre-training and finetuning. We also had a hands-on session where participants were able to implement these same ideas into code.
