collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'To tackle Romanized Bangla (commonly known as Banglish), the most widely used text form on social media, we introduce BanglaTLit and BanglaTLit-PT â€” two large-scale datasets that fuel state-of-the-art performance in Banglish NLP. Our novel back-transliteration techniques and further-pretrained encoders unlock the full potential of this noisy yet rich linguistic resource.'
