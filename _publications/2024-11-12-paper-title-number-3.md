title: "BanglaTLit: A Benchmark Dataset for Back-Transliteration of Romanized Bangla"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'To tackle Romanized Bangla (commonly known as Banglish), the most widely used text form on social media, we introduce BanglaTLit and BanglaTLit-PT â€” two large-scale datasets that fuel state-of-the-art performance in Banglish NLP. Our novel back-transliteration techniques and further-pretrained encoders unlock the full potential of this noisy yet rich linguistic resource.'

Low-resource languages like Bangla are severely limited by the lack of datasets. Romanized Bangla texts are ubiquitous on the internet, offering a rich source of data for Bangla NLP tasks and extending the available data sources. However, due to the informal nature of romanized text, they often lack the structure and consistency needed to provide insights. We address these challenges by proposing: (1) BanglaTLit, the large-scale Bangla transliteration dataset consisting of 42.7k samples, (2) BanglaTLitPT, a pre-training corpus on romanized Bangla with 245.7k samples, (3) encoders further-pretrained on BanglaTLit-PT achieving state-of-the-art performance in several romanized Bangla classification tasks, and (4) multiple back-transliteration baseline methods, including a novel encoder-decoder architecture using further pre-trained encoders. Our results show the potential of automated Bangla back-transliteration in utilizing the untapped sources of romanized Bangla to enrich this language.
