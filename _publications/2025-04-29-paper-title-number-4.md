excerpt: 'As transliterated Bangla (Banglish) is one of the most common forms of online communication, detecting hate content in this form is crucial. We present BANTH, the first multi-label transliterated Bangla hate speech dataset. We also propose a novel translation-based prompting strategy with LLMs achieving superior performance over existing baselines and paving the way for more effective hate speech detection in underrepresented languages.'
