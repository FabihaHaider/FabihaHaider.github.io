excerpt: 'In this research project, we explored the performance of Large Vision-Language Models on Bangla Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Due to the lack of existing datasets in this domain, we developed a novel dataset specifically tailored for Bangla VQA. We conducted a series of experiments from multiple perspectives to effectively address our research objectives.'
