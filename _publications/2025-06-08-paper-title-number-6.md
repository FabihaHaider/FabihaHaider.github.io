title: "BanglaProtha: Evaluating Vision Language Models in Underrepresented Long-tail Cultural Contexts"
collection: publications
category: under_review
excerpt: 'BanglaProtha dataset is a VQA dataset, containing images that encapsulate Bengali cultural elements, questions in native Bengali, and semantically similar multiple-choice answer options. Our experiments provide behavioral insights of VLMs across prompting & fine-tuning strategies, cultural aspects, model size, and augmentation methods. Our work serves as a diagnostic tool for addressing and mitigating inequalities in multicultural and multilingual settings, thereby bringing efforts to democratize AI systems.'
