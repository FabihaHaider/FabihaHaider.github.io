title: "BanglaProtha: Evaluating Vision Language Models in Underrepresented Long-tail Cultural Contexts"
collection: publications
category: under_review
excerpt: 'BanglaProtha dataset is a VQA dataset, containing images that encapsulate Bengali cultural elements, questions in native Bengali, and semantically similar multiple-choice answer options. Our experiments provide behavioral insights of VLMs across prompting & fine-tuning strategies, cultural aspects, model size, and augmentation methods. Our work serves as a diagnostic tool for addressing and mitigating inequalities in multicultural and multilingual settings, thereby bringing efforts to democratize AI systems.'

The advanced multimodal processing of current vision language models (VLMs) has prompted rigorous benchmarking in multicultural settings, revealing a clear inclination toward Western culture. While the bias likely stems from the predominance of Western-centric images in the VLM pretraining data, the resulting long-tail distribution problem is only exacerbated in underrepresented cultural settings, such as Bengali. Our work explores this problem through an aspect-based evaluation of several classes of VLMs on the rich Bengali culture. Our BanglaProtha dataset is a VQA dataset, containing images that encapsulate Bengali cultural elements, questions in native Bengali, and semantically similar multiple-choice answer options. Our experiments provide behavioral insights of VLMs across prompting \& fine-tuning strategies, cultural aspects, model size, and augmentation methods. Our work serves as a diagnostic tool for addressing and mitigating inequalities in multicultural and multilingual settings, thereby bringing efforts to democratize AI systems.
